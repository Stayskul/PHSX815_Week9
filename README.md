# PHSX815_Week9
contains the homework for week 9


This code contains myown work from past repositories (https://github.com/Stayskul/PHSX815_Week8/)
Also contains code from:

This homework (#10) is a code to minimize a function of two or more variables using the scipy.optimize library, and is very simple to run.
First you need to define your variables and function. I used x1, x2 = x (2 variables), and a simple paraboloid, for which I know where the minimum is.
Next simply run python3 MultiVarMin.py. This will either output the location of the  minimum and the minimum value, if a min exists, or "cannot find minimum" if there is no real minimum.
